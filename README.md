# ZeroingGcodeGenerator

This is an very simple html-file to generate gcode for zeroing an ShapeOko3 with an self made probe block. The code should work with every gbrl compatible cnc maschine. 

# Still an ProofOfConcept
This is mainly a kind of POC to generate an Gcode-file for every diameter of the milling bit.

# Features
- choose between "mm" or "in" as unit
- Insert dimensions of the bit and probe block
- get the gcode as text or as file for download

# How to build an probe block DIY
Maybe there will be a videotutorial but not at the moment.
